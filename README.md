# ohno_story_corpus

This repository contains the 30 AI-generated stories referenced in the paper "Tales of Trouble: Evaluating the impact of internal conflict on human enjoyment of LLM-generated flash fiction". 

The stories are structured into the three categories: 
- T1: stories with explicit internal conflict, based on two human values that clash in a situation
- T2: stories explicitly without any internal conflict, based on two human values that are in harmony in a situation
- T0: unrestricted stories without any conflict instructions or value-based traits

Addttionally, the list of value pairs powering the T1 and T2 stories is stored in its own file.
