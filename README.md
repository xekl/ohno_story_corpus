# ohno_story_corpus

This repository contains the 30 AI-generated stories referenced in the "Tales of Trouble" paper.

The stories are structured into the three categories: 
- (con): stories with explicit internal conflict, based on two human values that clash in a situation
- (non): stories explicitly without any internal conflict, based on two human values that are in harmony in a situation
- (base): unrestricted stories without any conflict instructions or value-based traits

Addttionally, the list of value pairs powering the (con) and (non) stories is stored in its own file.
